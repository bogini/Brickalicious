bricksviewer 0.0.7:
--------------
  -  fair amount of refactoring of io code
  
  -  added functionality to load brick XML and calculate normals
     at build time, then save these objects using serialization.
     At run time the serialized objects are loaded with normals
     already computed.
  
  -  added functionality so normal style can be specified per face
     so shapes like solid stud can render correctly
  
  -  added applet which will make use of JOGL if it is installed on
     the system, or fall back on JGL if not.

  -  added functionality to position camera based on LXFML

  -  fixed "bug" in normal calculation where "flat" objects were being calculated
     as "curved" objects

     libraries

  -  fixed nasty copy/paste error in calculation of normals which was
     leading to some very odd lighting effects
  
  -  fixed flipped Z coordinate bug
  
  -  fixed y offset coordinate "bug" where bricksviewer models were centered at 0
     instead of based at 0
  
  -  fixed bug where camera lost context between mouse drags
  
  -  added functionality to use GL display lists based on brick count in
     scene
